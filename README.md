# Pong-2D-in-Unity-
A little Game made in Unity (C#) to test the Unity environment and practice Collision, Movement and simple AI. 
Very very simple Game and one of my first projects, to Play the Game simply start "Pong2D.exe" in the "Final Game"-Folder.
Rules:

Press Space to start, game ends after Player or AI scores 3 Goals. 
If you open the Game in Unity you can set the public variables like difficulty (increases with passed time atm) and movement speed of player1.
